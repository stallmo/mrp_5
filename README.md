This is the repository for all code that is related to the above Master's Research Project at Maastricht University.

The requirements.txt should contain all packages that are needed to run the code.


### Structure of the repository

* code
  * all python code goes here
* notebooks
  * all jupyter notebooks go here
* data
  * the data goes in here, but should not be committed! Every developper has the data locally stored.

### Basic proceeding for adding code
(eventually create issue)

1. create new branch
2. checkout branch
3. develop on new branch
4. commit to new branch
5. when the code is tested and ready, merge the branch into master
